Create a new form named 'functionCompare'. 
The user wants to change their password. Get their new password from them in the main program. Then ask for it again. 
Create a function named 'Compare' that takes two arguments (pass1, pass2), is called from the main program, and returns a true if the two passwords passed in are the same, or a false if they are not the same.
Hint: .localeCompare() is a handy string method..... (see https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_localecompare.asp (Links to an external site.) )
Call the function from the main program and pass the two passwords to the function.  
Back in the main program, output a message to the console: 
The passwords are the same. 
OR
The passwords are not the same.
